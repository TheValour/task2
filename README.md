# React User Display App

This is a simple React application that demonstrates fetching user data from an API and displaying it in the UI using Axios.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing
```
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheValour/task2.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd task2
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the App

To run the application locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the app by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## API Integration

The app makes an API call to retrieve a list of users. The API endpoint used is [https://602e7c2c4410730017c50b9d.mockapi.io/users](https://602e7c2c4410730017c50b9d.mockapi.io/users). You can replace this URL with your own API endpoint.

The API response is an array of JSON objects, where each object represents a user with properties like `id`, `name`, and `email`.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Axios](https://reactjs.org/) - a promise-based HTTP client, to make API calls and fetch user data from the [https://602e7c2c4410730017c50b9d.mockapi.io/users](https://602e7c2c4410730017c50b9d.mockapi.io/users) endpoint.

- [TailWind CSS](https://reactjs.org/) - The app's user interface is styled using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that makes styling and customization efficient and straightforward.
